On the night the satellites blinked, Mara watched the ocean freeze into a mirror. The city lights bent across it, wrong and beautiful. Her wrist console hummed, whispering coordinates nobody sent. Above, the sky folded like paper, revealing gears of pale fire. Time stuttered. People paused mid-step, rain hanging like beads. Mara alone moved, breath loud, heart louder. She stepped forward, boots cracking ice, toward a horizon stitched with numbers. Something ancient had finally noticed Earth, and it had pressed a finger against the glass, curious. It smiled without a face, and the world held its breath in silence eternal.
