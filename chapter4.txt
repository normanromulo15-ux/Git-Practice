Years later, textbooks called it the Great Continuation. Mara refused titles and kept walking shorelines, listening. The watching thing learned kindness slowly, copying human errors first. Earth changed, but remained itself. Nights still blinked with stars, honest again. When the sky folded sometimes, Mara smiled. She had answered curiosity with courage.

Mara aged, laughed, loved, and taught children how to listen back. The cosmos answered softly, patient, waiting for better questions from its newest neighbors today.
